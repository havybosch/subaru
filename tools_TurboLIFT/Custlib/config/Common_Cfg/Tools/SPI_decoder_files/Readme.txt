FOLDER : SPI_decoder_files
--------------------------
 This folder should contain the SPI decoder files (*.spi).

 SPI files contain the SPI commands and the SPI signals 
   which will be used for regular testing activities.

 The names are used in the Test specifications and
   will be passed to the testscripts via 
     the LIFT_spi_access including LIFT_spi_database Library.
 

 Updates: SPI files are going to be updated regularly with new SPI signals.
          The names must absolutely match with the corresponding Datasheets
          Eventually included special characters can be kept. They will be ignored.

 Usages : SPI files shall be always taken into the customer projects and 
          to be included in the SPIMaid-projects-files (*.prj)
